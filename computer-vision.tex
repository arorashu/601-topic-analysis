	\section{Standard defined tasks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Image classification
		\item Image captioning
		\item Object localization
		\item Segmentation
		\item Object Detection
		
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Important Ideas}
	\subsection{Backpropagation}
	
	\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)}
		\paragraph{Yann LeCun}
			1998 - LeNet-5 was one of the first NN that utilized backpropagation using Supervised Learning
			
		\paragraph{How does it work}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Func from raw pixel -> n numbres (classs cores) 
			\item dot products and max operations 
		\end{itemize}
			
	\subsection{Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)}
		\paragraph{AlexNet}
		2012 - Image classifier on the ImageNet database. Built upon 1998 CNN work, scaled it up and run on GPU's
		\paragraph{Major Improvements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reduced code complexity as it utilized homogeneous architectures
			\item no need to do complex step of feature extraction
			\item Made it easier to do Transfer Learning
		\end{itemize}
		\paragraph{Industry applications}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Face Recognition
			\item Self driving cars
			\item Image captioning?
			\item building block in Reinforcement Learning computations
		\end{itemize} 
	
	\subsection{Residual Networks (ResNet)}
		\paragraph{ResNet}
		2015 - Microsoft Research - Much better performance
